## Abstract

We present Monascheme, an extensible aspect-oriented programming language based
on monadic aspect weaving. Extensions to the aspect language are defined as
monads, enabling easy, simple and modular prototyping. The language is
implemented as an embedded language in Racket. We illustrate the approach with
an execution level monad and a level-aware exception transformer. Semantic
variations can be obtained through monad combinations. This work is also a
first step towards a framework for controlling aspects with monads in the
pointcut and advice model of AOP.
