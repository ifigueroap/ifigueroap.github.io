Today, I'm starting the path to achieve the [AWS Solutions Architect (Associate)](https://aws.amazon.com/es/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) certification. I will be studying from the [A Cloud Guru](https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru) platform, with the gentle sponsorship of my employer :)

In order to make it a truly from-scratch experience, I just completed the [Introduction to Cloud Computing](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/intro-cloud-computing/) course, from where I'd like to highlight that:

* one of the biggest innovations of cloud technology is its *elasticity* (grow
or shrink in resource usage as you like), and *pay-as-you-go* billing model,
which shifts huge capital expenses into more manageable operation costs.

* at A Cloud Guru they are pretty explicit about the cloud being *"someone
else's computer"*.

* as much as I don't like it, it seems that *serverless* approaches are the
future of technology.

Finally, I really like the concept of companies that are *"technology
companies"* first, with a specific domain of application (banking, commerce,
etc) in second place---with a focus on using enabling cloud technology to
quickly set up *whatever it is that differentiates them from their
competitors*. In other words, cloud computing enable companies to focus on
delivering value, quickly.
