Welcome to my personal website, here you will find about my work as a (former)
researcher and lead software engineer.

Feel free to see my work trajectory in the [Vitae](/vitae) section, my current
list of (not so recent) academic [publications](/publications), as well as
[software projects](/projects) in which I've been mostly involved in the past
years.

I hope to regularly publish short posts regarding technology, mostly as a
reminder to myself. I hope this might be useful for you too!

Welcome!
